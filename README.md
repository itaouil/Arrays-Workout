# **Arrays-Workout**

### Reminder:

- Filter: Get object/array and filters from it all instances that do not hold a true value on the filter function.
- Map   : Get object/array and iterates over all instances and does something (return an array).
- Reduce: Get object/array and iterates over all instances and computes value, create new object.
- Sort  : Get object/array and iterates over all instances and sorts depending on a sorting function or string unicode (default).
